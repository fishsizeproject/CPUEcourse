# General linear mixed models: data from electrofishing surveys

In this second module of the course we will repeat the basic concepts of linear model fitting. The course will then introduce the concept of mixed linear models, fixed and random variables and how they should be selected and treated. The example data set uses catches from bitterling electrofishing surveys in South Moravia (1995-1998).
