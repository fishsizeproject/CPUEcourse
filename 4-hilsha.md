<sub>[Course Overview](index.md) \> Zero inflated general linear mixed models</sub>

# Zero inflated general linear mixed models: artisanal fishing data analysis

This is a third module of the course, where we will again repeat the basic concepts of fitting and understanding outputs of linear and mixed effect models. The example data set uses FAO data on hilsa shad (Tenualosa ilisha) catches in Bangladesh (1992-1993). We will aim to standardise caches of hilsa based on the net lenght, number of days fishing, area and month. We will introduce a concept of zero inflated models and how to deal with datasets that have a lot of zero entries.
